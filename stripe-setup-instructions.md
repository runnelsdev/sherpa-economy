# Stripe Setup Instructions for Sherpa Economy Website

## Overview
This setup integrates Stripe payments for:
- Book pre-orders ($24.99)
- Consulting consultations ($250)
- Speaking engagement deposits ($1,000)
- Assessment reports ($49.99)

## 1. Stripe Account Setup

### Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account
2. Complete business verification
3. Enable your account for live payments

### Get API Keys
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Developers > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_`)
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_`)

## 2. Update Configuration

### Update stripe-config.js
Replace the placeholder in `stripe-config.js`:
```javascript
const STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = 'pk_test_...'; // Replace with your actual publishable key
```

### Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_AwTlcHPBYYURE75CNMwpq6XE  # Your live publishable key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_SDimTmsQzRG8I4L9K37mEpU4       # Your live secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...                          # Webhook secret (see step 4)
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Set Up Webhooks

### Create Webhook Endpoint
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. Select events to listen for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### Update Environment Variables
Add the webhook secret to your environment variables.

## 5. Deploy to Netlify

### üîê CRITICAL: Set Environment Variables in Netlify
**SECURITY WARNING**: Never put your secret key in client-side code!

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
3. Add these variables (EXACT NAMES REQUIRED):
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: `sk_live_SDimTmsQzRG8I4L9K37mEpU4`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your webhook signing secret (from step 4)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The secret key should ONLY exist in Netlify environment variables, never in your code files!

### Deploy
Your site will automatically deploy when you push changes to your repository.

## 6. Test the Integration

### Test Mode
- Use Stripe test mode first
- Test card numbers: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Visa)
- Use any future expiration date and any CVC

### Live Mode
- Switch to live mode in Stripe Dashboard
- Update your publishable key in the code
- Test with real payment methods

## 7. Product Pricing Configuration

Current pricing is set in `stripe-config.js`:
- Book: $24.99 (2499 cents)
- Consultation: $250.00 (25000 cents)
- Speaking: $1,000.00 (100000 cents)
- Assessment: $49.99 (4999 cents)

To change prices, update the `PRODUCTS` object in `stripe-config.js`.

## 8. Email Notifications (Optional)

The webhook handler includes email notification functions that you can implement with your preferred email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.).

Update the email functions in `netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.js` to integrate with your email service.

## 9. üîê Security Considerations - CRITICAL

### **‚úÖ What's SECURE in Your Current Setup:**
- Secret key is ONLY in server-side Netlify Functions
- Client-side code only uses publishable key (safe to expose)
- Webhooks verify signatures to prevent tampering
- All payment processing happens server-side

### **üö® NEVER DO THESE:**
- ‚ùå Put `sk_live_...` or `sk_test_...` in any JavaScript file
- ‚ùå Commit secret keys to Git/GitHub
- ‚ùå Store secrets in `.env` files that get committed
- ‚ùå Use secret keys in browser console or client-side

### **‚úÖ Security Verification:**
1. Search your codebase for `sk_live_` - should find ZERO results in client files
2. Check browser developer tools - no secret keys should be visible
3. Verify environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard
4. Test that webhooks verify signatures properly

### **üÜò If Secret Key is Compromised:**
1. Immediately regenerate it in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update Netlify environment variable
3. Deploy your site
4. Test everything still works
