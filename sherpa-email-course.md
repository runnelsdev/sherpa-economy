## Day 1: The Death of the Guru Economy

**Subject Line:** The $12,000 leadership course that changed everything

**Preview Text:** She had all the knowledge but felt more lost than ever...

Dear [Name],

Three months ago, Sarah sat across from me, exhausted.

She'd just spent $12,000 on leadership courses in six months. She could recite every leadership framework, quote every guru, and had a shelf full of certificates.

"David," she said, "I know more about leadership than I ever have, but I feel more lost than when I started. Everyone's telling me what the summit looks like, but nobody's showing me the next step up this mountain."

That conversation crystallized something I'd been witnessing for years in my consulting work.

**We're drowning in gurus pointing at distant peaks, but starving for guides willing to walk alongside us.**

Here's what's happening:
- ChatGPT can give you any leadership framework in seconds
- Online courses promise transformation but deliver information
- Social media is full of people shouting from mountaintops
- Everyone's an expert, but nobody's a companion

The result? Information overload. Analysis paralysis. And leaders who feel more isolated than ever.

But there's a shift happening. And it's changing everything.

Tomorrow, I'll share what I learned from the actual Sherpas of Nepal that completely transformed how I think about leadership.

But for now, ask yourself:
**Are you trying to be the expert with all the answers? Or the guide willing to walk alongside others?**

The difference changes everything.

Walking alongside you,
David Runnels

## Day 2: What Real Sherpas Taught Me About Leadership

**Subject Line:** "You have everything wrong about being a Sherpa"

**Preview Text:** Pemba's words rewrote everything I thought I knew...

Dear [Name],

The first thing Pemba told me was that I had everything wrong about what it means to be a Sherpa.

I was sitting in a tea house in Namche Bazaar, gateway to Everest, explaining my idea of "Sherpa leadership" to this man who'd summited Everest seven times.

"You think being a Sherpa is about helping people climb mountains," he said. "But for us, the mountain isn't something to conquer. It's something to respect. And being a guide isn't about taking people where they want to go. It's about helping them go where they need to go safely."

That distinction changed everything.

Here are the 4 Sherpa principles that transformed my entire consulting practice:

**1. Guides Don't Create the Path, They Know the Path**
The paths through mountains have existed for centuries. Your job isn't to be innovative—it's to recognize patterns others have successfully navigated.

**2. Manage Risk, Don't Guarantee Outcomes**
Pemba never promises anyone will reach the summit. He promises to help them make the best decisions with the information available.

**3. Succeed When Others Succeed (Without Taking Credit)**
"When someone reaches the summit, it's their achievement. I just helped them not get lost."

**4. The Mountain Teaches the Guide**
"Every person I guide teaches me something new about the mountain."

After implementing these principles, my client Marcus expanded his nonprofit's services by 40% during the pandemic while others were closing.

Not because I had the answers. But because I was willing to walk alongside him through the uncertainty.

Tomorrow, I'll show you why AI makes this approach more valuable, not less.

Question for reflection: **Which of these 4 principles challenges your current leadership style the most?**

From the mountain,
David

## Day 3: Why AI Makes Human Guides Priceless

**Subject Line:** ChatGPT gave perfect advice. It still wasn't enough.

**Preview Text:** The paradox that's creating massive opportunity...

Dear [Name],

A Fortune 500 executive recently told me something fascinating:

"ChatGPT gave me a perfect 10-step plan for organizational transformation. But you helped me figure out which step to take first, held my hand through the fear, and picked me up when step three failed. That's the difference."

We're living through a paradox:
- AI can generate expert-level answers instantly
- Knowledge is free and infinite
- Yet people feel more lost than ever
- And my consulting practice has never been busier

Why?

**Because AI can tell you WHAT to do, but it can't walk alongside you WHILE you do it.**

Here's what AI can't do:
- Share scars from its own journey
- Hold space for your fear and uncertainty
- Celebrate your small wins with genuine joy
- Adjust when Plan A fails (based on lived experience)
- Provide accountability through relationship

This creates massive opportunity for those willing to be guides.

Raj Patel, CEO of TechForward, proved this. After implementing Sherpa principles:
- Turnover dropped 52%
- Revenue increased 28%
- Employee engagement hit record highs

His secret? He stopped measuring managers by their expertise and started measuring them by how many people they helped succeed.

"When your leaders become guides instead of gurus, everything changes," Raj told me.

The future belongs to those who can do what AI cannot: Be genuinely, vulnerably, consistently human.

Tomorrow, I'll share the practical framework for discovering your unique "Inner Sherpa."

But today, consider: **What human value do you provide that no AI ever could?**

In the age of artificial intelligence, authentic guidance is priceless.

## Day 4: Your Scars Are Someone Else's Roadmap

**Subject Line:** The sentence that changed how I see everything

**Preview Text:** Every difficult experience you've navigated is actually...

Dear [Name],

During my darkest professional moment—when a major client relationship imploded spectacularly—my mentor said something I'll never forget:

"Your scars are someone else's roadmap."

I didn't understand it then. I was too busy feeling like a failure.

But now, that failed client relationship is the story I tell most often. Because dozens of consultants have avoided the same pitfall after hearing about my mistake.

Here's the framework I use to help clients transform their struggles into guidance:

**The S.C.A.R. Method:**

**S - Story:** What happened? (Without drama or victimhood)
**C - Challenge:** What made it difficult? (The universal struggle)
**A - Approach:** How did you navigate it? (The practical steps)
**R - Roadmap:** What would you tell someone facing this now? (The guidance)

Example from Jennifer at Microsoft:
- **Story:** Promoted to management, team rebelled
- **Challenge:** Impostor syndrome, trying to prove expertise
- **Approach:** Stopped pretending to have all answers, became vulnerable
- **Roadmap:** "Lead with questions, not answers. Your uncertainty is relatable."

Result: 34% increase in team engagement.

Your turn. Think about:
1. Your biggest professional failure
2. Your most painful personal growth moment
3. The mistake that taught you the most

These aren't just your stories. They're someone else's survival guide.

Rev. Michael Chen quadrupled his church's small group participation after realizing this: "People don't want perfect leaders—they want authentic guides who've walked through the valley too."

Tomorrow, I'll share the 5 practices that turn you from advice-giver to authentic guide.

But right now, I want you to list three scars that could become someone's roadmap.

Because someone, somewhere, needs exactly what your journey taught you.

Walking through it with you,
David

## Day 5: The 5 Daily Practices of Sherpa Leaders

**Subject Line:** How to implement everything (starting Monday)

**Preview Text:** Simple practices that create extraordinary results...

Dear [Name],

We've covered a lot this week:
- Why guides matter more than gurus
- The 4 Sherpa principles
- Why AI makes guides priceless
- How scars become roadmaps

Now let's make it practical.

Here are the 5 daily practices I've seen transform ordinary managers into Sherpa leaders:

**1. The Morning Question (2 minutes)**
Instead of: "What do I need to accomplish today?"
Ask: "Who might need my support today?"

**2. The Accompaniment Check (Throughout the day)**
When someone brings you a problem, pause and ask yourself:
"Do they need my expertise, or my presence?"
(Hint: It's usually presence)

**3. The Pattern Practice (5 minutes at lunch)**
Write down one challenge you're seeing repeatedly.
Note how you've seen others navigate it successfully.
This builds your pattern library for guidance.

**4. The Credit Transfer (End of day)**
Identify one success from today.
Instead of taking credit, celebrate the person who did the work.
Make their achievement visible to others.

**5. The Weekly Scar Share (Fridays)**
Share one lesson from a failure with your team.
Not as a teaching moment, but as a gift of vulnerability.
Watch how it transforms trust.

Marcus Thompson used these practices to expand Haven House Services by 40% during the pandemic.

"It wasn't complicated," he said. "I just stopped trying to have all the answers and started walking alongside my team through the uncertainty."

**Your Sherpa Economy Action Plan:**

Week 1: Implement the Morning Question
Week 2: Add the Accompaniment Check
Week 3: Start the Pattern Practice
Week 4: Practice Credit Transfer
Week 5: Begin Weekly Scar Shares

By week 6, you'll have transformed how you lead.

Not through complexity. Through consistency.

**What's Next?**

This email course was just the beginning. If you're ready to go deeper:

1. **Get the Book:** "Sherpa Economy" releases next month with 12 chapters of frameworks, case studies, and practical tools. [Pre-order at 30% off →]

2. **Join the Certification:** Our Sherpa Leadership Certification launches with 100 beta participants. [Apply for early access →]

3. **Book a Workshop:** Bring these principles to your organization. [Learn about corporate training →]

But honestly? Just start with the Morning Question on Monday.

Ask yourself: "Who might need my support today?"

Then show up for them. Not as the expert with all the answers. But as the guide willing to walk alongside them.

That's how movements begin. One person. One question. One day at a time.

Thank you for taking this journey with me. The summit isn't the point—the people you bring with you are.

Walking alongside you always,
David Runnels

P.S. Hit reply and tell me which practice you're implementing first. I read every email, and your story might become someone else's roadmap.

Subject: Story idea: Why ChatGPT makes human guides more valuable, not less

Hi [Host Name],

Just listened to your episode with [Recent Guest] about [Topic]. Your point about [specific insight] really resonated.

I have a counterintuitive take your audience might love:

While everyone fears AI will replace human leaders, I've found the opposite through my work with 45+ organizations. AI handles information, but people desperately need guides who can walk alongside them through uncertainty.

I call it the "Sherpa Economy" (based on fieldwork in Nepal + client results):
- Microsoft manager increased engagement 34% by becoming a guide vs. guru
- Nonprofit expanded 40% during COVID using Sherpa principles
- CEO reduced turnover 52% by measuring managers on who they elevate

Happy to share:
- The 4 Sherpa principles that transform organizations
- Why your scars are someone else's roadmap
- How to be AI-proof by being genuinely human

Would this resonate with your audience?

Best,
David
